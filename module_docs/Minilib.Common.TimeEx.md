## Values

### `namespace Minilib.Common.TimeEx`

#### `_repeat_io : Std::IO a -> Std::I64 -> Std::IO a`

#### `consumed_realtime_while_io : Std::IO a -> Std::IO (a, Std::F64)`

Get wall-clock time elapsed while executing an I/O action.

#### `measure_time : Std::F64 -> (() -> a) -> Std::IO (Std::F64, a)`

Measures wall-clock time per a function call.
Specifically, It calls the function many times until the specified time limit (in second) passes
and measures the total time.
Returns the measured time per loop (in second) and the IO operation result.
NOTE: The measured time per loop has a overhead about 0.1~1.0 usec.

#### `measure_time_io : Std::F64 -> Std::IO a -> Std::IO (Std::F64, a)`

Measures wall-clock time per an IO operation.
Specifically, It performs an IO operation many times until the specified time limit (in second) passes
and measures the total time.
Returns the measured time per loop (in second) and the IO operation result.
NOTE: The measured time per loop has a overhead about 0.1~1.0 usec.

#### `notimeit : [a : Std::ToString] Std::String -> (() -> a) -> Std::IO a`

Same interface as `timeit()` but does not measure time.

#### `timeit : [a : Std::ToString] Std::String -> (() -> a) -> Std::IO a`

Measures wall-clock time per a function call.
Specifically, It calls the function many times and measures the total time.
It then prints the function result and measured time per loop.
NOTE: The measured time per loop has a overhead about 0.1~1.0 usec.

#### `timeit_io : [a : Std::ToString] Std::String -> Std::IO a -> Std::IO a`

Measures wall-clock time per an IO operation.
Specifically, It performs an IO operation many times and measures the total time.
It then prints the IO operation result and measured time per loop.
NOTE: The measured time per loop has a overhead about 0.1~1.0 usec.

#### `usleep : Std::U32 -> Std::IO::IOFail ()`

Sleeps for specified micro-seconds.
